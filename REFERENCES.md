# Overview

This file is to list various references that are of use in developing the local codebase and their use.  The various
RDF datastream libraries are fairly new in Hydra so much of our code and implementation is based on examples given
to us in the Advanced Hydra camp, that we find online or that we encounter by interacting with the Hydra Community.

Much of the RDF Datastream elements used by hydra inherit from this library so direct reference is useful, particularly
when using the vocabularies they have defined there.
